# Enhanced Wallet Security Integration

## Overview
The 40 Acres platform now features comprehensive cryptocurrency wallet security analysis combining two powerful APIs:

- **E0G Trust API**: Real-time wallet security analysis with threat scoring
- **Bridge Analytics API**: Transaction history tracking and compliance assessment

## Architecture

### E0G Trust API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `http://134.122.21.37:8000`
- **Health Check**: `/api/e0g/health`
- **Analysis**: `/api/e0g/analyze`
- **Features**:
  - Risk scoring (0-100)
  - Threat level classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
  - Security pattern detection
  - Real-time monitoring of 427,047+ threat patterns
  - Monitoring 2.46M+ addresses

### Bridge Analytics API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `https://api.bridge-analytics.net/demo`
- **Health Check**: `/api/bridge/health`
- **Analysis**: `/api/bridge/analyze-history`
- **Features**:
  - Transaction count analysis
  - Total volume tracking
  - Compliance score calculation (0-100%)
  - Risk indicator identification
  - Activity pattern analysis

## Implementation Details

### Server Components
- `server/e0gRoutes.ts`: E0G Trust API integration
- `server/bridgeAnalyticsService.ts`: Bridge Analytics API integration
- Both services configured in `server/index.ts`

### Frontend Components
- `client/src/pages/WalletSecurity.tsx`: Main security dashboard
- `client/src/components/EnhancedWalletAnalysis.tsx`: Comprehensive analysis interface
- `client/src/components/InvestmentModal.tsx`: Investment workflow with security verification

## Security Workflow

### Investment Security Verification
1. User selects Bitcoin payment method (Gold membership required)
2. User connects cryptocurrency wallet
3. System runs parallel security analysis:
   - E0G Trust API: Security risk assessment
   - Bridge Analytics: Transaction history analysis
4. Combined risk assessment determines investment eligibility:
   - **HIGH** threat level OR compliance score < 60%: **BLOCKED**
   - **MEDIUM** threat level OR compliance score 60-79%: **WARNING**
   - **LOW** threat level AND compliance score ≥ 80%: **APPROVED**

### Risk Assessment Criteria
- **E0G Security Score**: 0-100 (lower = higher risk)
- **Bridge Compliance Score**: 0-100% (higher = better compliance)
- **Combined Decision Matrix**:
  - High Risk: E0G threat level HIGH OR Bridge compliance < 60%
  - Moderate Risk: E0G threat level MEDIUM OR Bridge compliance 60-79%
  - Low Risk: E0G threat level LOW AND Bridge compliance ≥ 80%

## API Status Monitoring
- Real-time health checks for both services
- Visual status indicators in UI
- Graceful degradation with enhanced analysis fallbacks
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## User Experience Features
- **Wallet Security Center**: Dedicated page for comprehensive analysis
- **Enhanced Investment Modal**: Integrated security verification
- **Real-time Analysis**: Immediate security feedback
- **Visual Risk Indicators**: Clear threat level and compliance displays
- **Investment Protection**: Automatic blocking of high-risk transactions
